        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup rice vinegar</li>
            <li>1 2 inch square kombu</li>
            <li>3 tbsp sugar</li>
            <li>1 tbsp kosher salt</li>
            <li>2 cups short grain rice</li>
            <li>2 1/4 cups water</li>
            <li>1 cup kewpie mayo</li>
            <li>3 tbsp sriracha</li>
            <li>2 tsp gochujang</li>
            <li>1 thinly sliced green onion</li>
            <li>Drops of sesame oil</li>
            <li>3 tbsp Spicy Mayo mix</li>
            <li>8 oz Kvaroy Arctic Salmon</li>
            <li>2 tsp furikake seasoning</li>
            <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>1-2 cucumber sticks per roll</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice the ingredients into thin strips. Even with larger rolls like this one, ingredients shouldn't be more than about <strong> <em>Â¼-inch // 1 cm thick</em> </strong>  or it will quickly get hard to roll them up.</li>
            <li>Place a sheet of nori <strong> <em>shiny-side down.</em> </strong>  The duller-looking, grippy inside face is the one that gets the ingredients. Use about <strong> <em>half a cup of rice per roll</em> </strong>  and do your best to distribute it evenly over the nori. Leave a border at the far end for sealing.</li>
            <li> <strong> <em>Layer the ingredients</em> </strong> toward the side of the nori that's closest to you.</li>
            <li>Rolling is a <strong> <em>two-part process.</em> </strong>  First you <strong> <em>tuck in the ingredients</em> </strong>  and check to make sure they're secure. Then you <strong> <em>seal the roll.</em> </strong> </li>
        </ol>
